	<p>Welcome to the rules for season 2(b) "Season of the Clam" for our Destiny 1v1 league. Season 2(a) was abandoned due to the insane number of fixtures and a last-minute decision to re-work this in to a multi-league format. Our hope is that shorter seasons with promotions and relegations will make this more fun and competitive for everyone.</p>

	<div class="page-title">
		<h3>In short</h3>
	</div>
	<p>It's a multi-league format with everyone scheduled to play each other, home and away, within their league. At the end of the season the top player in each league is promoted to the next league up, except the player at the top of the top division who wins nothing! Similarly the bottom player of each league is relegated to the league below, all except for the bottom player in the bottom league who only earns a lasting sense of shame.</p>

	<div class="page-title">
		<h3>The game</h3>
	</div>
	<p>Home player sets the game up like this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Type: Rumble 1v1</li>
		<li>Score limit: 25</li>
		<li>Time limit: 10 minutes</li>
		<li>Map: Any</li>
		<li>Supers: Allowed</li>
		<li>Heavy: Not allowed</li>
	</ul>

	<p>What the fuck is this home and away nonsense? Easy. Home player chooses the map for "home advantage". Got a favourite or know your opponent is shit on one? Those would be good choices. The home player is on the left of the fixture list.</p>
	<p>You've banned heavy? Why you do dis? Because a block of heavy and a machine gun will get you 5 kills in the time it takes for the ammo to respawn. Not fun.</p>
	<p>All non-heavy weapons are allowed unless something crazy comes along.</p>
	<p>But supers are OK? Yep. It's a fairly level playing field and realistically you'll only get 1 kill.</p>

	<div class="page-title">
		<h3>Scoring</h3>
	</div>
	<p>Just like most sports:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Win: 3 points</li>
		<li>Draw: 1 point</li>
		<li>Loss: 0 points</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The winner sends a screenshot of the final result to Dan Orchard (who changes his PSN every 2 days) and he will update the results tables accordingly.</p>
	<p>Most points at the end of the league wins. If points scored are level then best KD (kills / deaths) wins, then it's most kills. Christ knows what we'll do if we're still tied then. Probably a brawl.</p>

	<div class="page-title">
		<h3>Schedule</h3>
	</div>
	<p>Games will take place weekly between Destiny resets, currently Tuesdays at 5pm (GMT). You will have at most 2 games per week. 1 home and 1 away against different opponents. By the end of the league everyone will have played everyone in your division twice. Some players will only see one game in a game week - this is to balance out a league with an even number of players.</p>
	<p>Attendance is key for the league to work and for everyone to have a good time. You only have to turn up for 2 games per week. That's 20 minutes. You can do it.</p>
	<p>You can view your fixtures for the entire league season as soon as they are published. Each week you and your opponent are responsible for arranging your match.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you can not do a particular week you forfeit the matches and your opponents get a no-score win</li>
		<li>If you do not turn up to an agreed match you forfeit the match and your opponent gets a no-score win</li>
		<li>If you both can not agree on a time that's also a no-score forfeit draw</li>
		<li>To claim a forfeit win you only have to demonstrate that you tried to, or managed to, arrange a scheduled match and your opponent didn't respond or didn't turn up</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We're willing to be flexible on this, we want games completed, not excuses. If you're on holiday, working 18 hour shifts, in hospital, dead, etc then just let us and your opponent know and you can reschedule. Just don't take the piss.</p>

	<div class="page-title">
		<h3>Prizes</h3>
	</div>
	<p>There are no prizes.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>1<sup>st</sup> Place - nothing</li>
		<li>2<sup>nd</sup> Place - still nothing</li>
		<li>3<sup>rd</sup> Place - fuck all</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Last place gets you a 2am, in person, double-dip teabagging experience from the one-and-only Lord 'scrote-dangler' Orchard on a night that is really inconvenient for you. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, don't lose. Failing that sleep with one eye open and your mouth closed.</p>

	<div class="page-title">
		<h3>Final Decisions</h3>
	</div>
	<p>This is not a democracy. There will be no votes, referendums, discussions or sharing circles. If in doubt, the final decision always rests with the league organiser, the Right-Honourable Chief Teabagger, LordOrchard. No further questions. If that seems unfair to you, yeah. It is. Life is unfair. Fuck you.</p>
